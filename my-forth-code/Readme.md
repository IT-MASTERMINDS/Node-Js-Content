### What is npm?

**npm** stands for Node Package Manager. It is the default package manager for Node.js and is used to manage dependencies for your projects. It allows you to install, update, and manage third-party libraries and tools that your Node.js project depends on.

### How npm Relates to Node.js

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine that allows you to execute JavaScript on the server side.
- **npm**: A package manager for Node.js that allows you to install packages (libraries or modules) that you can use in your Node.js applications.

### Why Use npm?

- **Dependency Management**: Easily manage and install project dependencies.
- **Version Control**: Specify and control the versions of dependencies.
- **Sharing**: Share your own packages with the community.
- **Scripts**: Define scripts that help in automating tasks related to your project.

## Getting Started with npm

Follow these steps to create a new Node.js project and manage it with npm.

### 1. Initialize a New Project

Create a new directory for your project and initialize it with npm:

```sh
mkdir my-first-nodejs-app
cd my-first-nodejs-app
npm init -y
```

The `npm init -y` command initializes a new Node.js project with default settings and creates a `package.json` file.

### 2. Install a Package

You can install packages using the `npm install` command. For example, to install the `express` package, which is a popular web framework for Node.js:

```sh
npm install express
```

This will create a `node_modules` directory and add `express` to your `package.json` dependencies.

### 3. Create a Server Script

Create a file named `npm-test.js` and add the following code to set up a basic HTTP server using the `express` package:

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}/`);
});
```

### 4. Run the Server

To start the server, run:

```sh
node npm-test.js
```

Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. You should see the message "Hello, World!".

## Example `package.json` File

Here is an example of what your `package.json` file might look like after installing `express`:

```json
{
  "name": "my-forth-code",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A simple Node.js application",
  "main": "server.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node server.js"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "Your Name",
  "license": "MIT",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.17.1"
  }
}
```

### Key Sections of `package.json`:

- **name**: The name of your project.
- **version**: The current version of your project.
- **description**: A brief description of your project.
- **main**: The entry point of your project.
- **scripts**: A set of script commands that can be run using `npm run`.
- **dependencies**: An object containing the dependencies of your project and their versions.
