Differences Between Regular Functions and Arrow Functions
In JavaScript, both regular functions and arrow functions can be used as callbacks. However, they have some key differences, particularly regarding the handling of the this keyword.

Regular Functions (function):

Have their own this context.
The this value depends on how the function is called.
Useful when you need to access properties of an object that calls the function.
Arrow Functions (=>):

Do not have their own this context.
They inherit this from the surrounding code at the time they are defined.
Useful when you want to maintain the this context of the enclosing scope.

Differences Highlighted
this Context:

Regular functions have their own this context, which can change depending on how the function is called.
Arrow functions do not have their own this context and will inherit this from the surrounding scope.
Syntax:

Regular functions use the function keyword.
Arrow functions use the => syntax, which is more concise.
Use Cases:

Use regular functions if you need to bind a specific this context or if you are working with methods in an object.
Use arrow functions for shorter syntax and to maintain the this context of the enclosing scope.
